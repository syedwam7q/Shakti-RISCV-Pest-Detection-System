Objective
This project aims to develop a device capable of detecting pests or crop diseases
using camera-based image analysis. Upon detection, the device will alert farmers,
enabling timely intervention and minimising crop damage.
Implementation
The implementation of this project will involve the following key components and
steps:
●
●
●
Hardware Setup: A low-cost camera will be attached to a Shakti-based
board. This ensures an economical yet powerful platform for image
acquisition and processing.
Image Processing Algorithm: A lightweight image processing algorithm will
be developed. This algorithm will be specifically designed to identify pest
patterns or leaf discoloration indicative of crop diseases.
Output and Alerts: The detection results will be communicated to farmers
through various alert mechanisms. This could include a buzzer, a local
display, or IoT notifications for remote monitoring.
RISC-V/Shakti Integration
The integration of RISC-V/Shakti architecture is crucial for the efficient and
optimised operation of the pest detection system:
●
●
Image Processing Pipeline Optimisation: The image processing pipeline
will be optimised by leveraging RISC-V’s parallel processing capabilities.
Additionally, custom instructions will be explored to accelerate specific
image analysis tasks.
Efficient Image Data Handling: Cache memory techniques will be employed
to handle image data efficiently on the Shakti processor. This will reduce
latency and improve the overall processing speed.
